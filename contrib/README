ircd-hybrid contributive add-ons ::

This directory contains contributive modules, patches and other add-ons 
that have been created by other people, or are not suitable to be included
into the main ircd-hybrid tree for various reasons. The coding team does
not officially support modules, patches and add-ons nor do they guarantee
that any of them will work to their intended capacity.

It is to be noted WITH feeling, that not all of these modules, patches
or add-ons have been thoroughly tested, only that they've been tested
enough to see if they compile or work. This is one of the main driving
reasons why many of these are not in the main ircd-hybrid tree.
Heed this warning!

Modules ::
-----------------------------------------------
m_operspy.c      --  This module will allow operators with access to spy on
                     users. It should be noted the notion of this module
                     practically invalidates any form of privacy.

                     Syntax: OPERSPY <LIST/WHO/MODE/WHOIS/NAMES> <parameter>

recode.c         --  Load this module to extend listen{} blocks with an
                     additional modifier, e.g. codepage = "iso-8859-2".
                     This makes ircd recode all traffic on a specific port
                     to/from utf-8.

                     The module is not yet ready to be used.

soft_reboot.c    --  If this module is mentioned in ircd.conf, you will be
                     able to perform a full server restart/upgrade without
                     disconnecting a single user or server (except SSL users).

example_module.c --  This is an example module template to help users create
                     their own modules.


Spy Modules ::
-----------------------------------------------

The following modules are the 'spy' parts and are accessible via the +y
user mode.

spy_admin_notice.c   -- Spy on clients doing ADMIN
spy_info_notice.c    -- Spy on clients doing INFO
spy_links_notice.c   -- Spy on clients doing LINKS
spy_motd_notice.c    -- Spy on clients doing MOTD
spy_stats_notice.c   -- Spy on clients doing all STATS
spy_stats_p_notice.c -- Spy on clients doing STATS p only
spy_trace_notice.c   -- Spy on clients doing TRACE/LTRACE
spy_whois_notice.c   -- Spy on local clients who WHOIS you.

Note: If you have both spy_stats_notice.c and spy_stats_p_notice.c
loaded at the same time you will get two messages. So only load one
or the other to avoid duplicate NOTICE events.


Other Files ::
-----------------------------------------------

Other files that have been put into the contrib directory but do not have
a specific category are listed here with a brief description of what they
are and what they do.

                    suitable for building ircd-hybrid on Windows with MSVC/BCC.
